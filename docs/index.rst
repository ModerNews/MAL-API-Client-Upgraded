===============================================
Welcome to MAL Client Upgraded's documentation!
===============================================

This is official documentation for malclient-upgraded, I'm still working on it (especially enums require rework) but here's
pretty much everything you need to know about this wrapper

Installation
============

It's very simple, all you need to do is type:


``pip install malclient-upgraded``


Then, if you're new you should check out info on :doc:`authorizing with MyAnimeList REST API <Quickstart>`,
as it's quite complicated for new users.
